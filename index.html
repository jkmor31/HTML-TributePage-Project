        <h2>Timeline of His Life</h2>
        <section id="tribute-info">
        <ul><li><b>1918</b> - Born in Rendcomb, a small village in Gloucestershire, England.</li>
            <li><b>1939</b> - Attended college at University of Cambridge, studying natural sciences</li>
            <li><b>1943</b> - Graduated PhD program from Cambridge and moved to London to work for the National Institute for Medical Research.</li>
        <li><b>1951-1952</b> - Discovered the complete amino acid sequence for bovine insulin A and B polypeptide chains.</li>
        <li><b>1958</b> - Won the Nobel prize in Chemistry for determining that every protein had a unique sequence.</li>
        <li><b>1964</b> - Discovered the formylmethionine tRNA which initiates protein synthesis in bacteria.</li>
            <li><b>1977</b> - Created the "Sanger Method", which introduced the "dideoxy" chain-termination method for sequencing DNA molecules.</li>
        <li><b>1980</b> - Won his second Nobel prize in Chemistry for his chain-termination method, which was later used in the sequencing of the human genome.</li> 
            <li><b>1993</b> - Helped open the Sanger Institue a few miles from his home. Now it is one of the world's largest research centers in human genome sequencing.</li>
        <li><b>2013</b> - Sanger died in Cambridge.</li></ul>
